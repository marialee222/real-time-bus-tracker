## Description
The Real-Time Bus Tracker is a web application that visualizes the movement of a bus along a predefined route with interactive features. The application uses Mapbox GL JS for mapping and provides a real-time tracking experience. 

### Improvements
 - set the height of the map to be 100% of the viewpoint height (CSS)
 - button styling (CSS)
 - cursor pointer (CSS)
 - button hover animation (CSS)
 - moved script tags to the end of the <body> section (HTML)
 - updated button label (HTML)
 - created a line for the bus marker (JS)

## How to Run
To run the Real-Time Bus Tracker on your machine, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/marialee222/real-time-bus-tracker.git
2. Open the project directory: cd real-time-bus-tracker
3. Open index.html in your web browser.

## Roadmap
Future improvements for the Real Time Bus Tracker include:
- When a user touches a stop, the schedule will appear on the bottom.
- On the schedule, user will find the actual day and the coming days with the next departing time.
- The schedule will include the stop name, address and time until the next bus.
	Example:
