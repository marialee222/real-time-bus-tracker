//Three bouncing balls in a box area were created by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The area of the bouncing balls was set and simple design and functionality added.

//No installation or setup instructions.

This project can be used to:
//1) decide the area where the bouncing balls will perform bouncing
//2) design the bouncing balls and add some bouncing functionality to them

Please comment to leave general comments or questions.  You can suggest changes that I can apply directly from your comment.

//Future iterations will include features to make it interactive. 

This is a work in progress.  Please feel free to expand and build upon the source code.  Feedback is welcome!
